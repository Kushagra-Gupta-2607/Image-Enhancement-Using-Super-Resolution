# Image-Enhancement-Using-Super-Resolution

• Gained an enhanced image by different practices: bicubic interpolation, SR-CNN and SR-GAN
• PSNR, MSE and SSIM were used as image quality metrics for SR using Convolutional Neural Network.
• Generator and Discriminator architecture were used for classification and plausible replication of image tile for SR
using Generative Adversarial Network.
